# corrupto
Command line corruptor written in C++

#### How to setup:

Linux: g++ corrupto.cpp -o corrupto (if it does not compile try using C++11 as standard libray).

OS X: Install brew, install g++ same as linux (may make a brew package for corrupto in the future)

Windows: I guess you use cygwin, but I have not tested it.

```

The minimum required options for corruption are:

File To Co
